<h3>What is this place?</h3>
<div class="box">

    There once was a master programmer who wrote unstructured programs.
    A novice programmer, seeking to imitate him, also began to write
    unstructured programs. When the novice asked the master to evaluate
    his progress, the master criticized him for writing unstructured programs,
    saying, ``What is appropriate for the master is not appropriate for the
    novice. You must understand the Tao before transcending structure.''
