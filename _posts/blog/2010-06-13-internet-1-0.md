Two years ago I was discovering a French speech made by
Benjamin Bayart about the evolution of Internet : 
__"Internet vs Minitel 2.0"__. The main idea of the speech
is that despite its nature, the Internet is evolving to a
centralized place, where services are at the center of the network.
You read your mails on google, you put your movies on youtube,
you put your life on facebook, ... When you are using internet,
you are a dumb terminal feeding and consuming centralized services.
This idea has haunted me for a while, but I've done nothing
to change my way of using Internet, until recently.

As I can't host my own data on a computer that I can physically
access (I don't control my Internet connection, and I don't have
an enough stable situation to be sure that what I host will be
there in 6 months), I've decided to move everything to a server.
I'm aware this is not the best answer, as I'm still depending on
OVH. At least, I have a better control of my data and I know there
is no kind of magic operating on the background, more, that
shouldn't be too hard to move from the server to something
home hosted.

I've started to remove and replace one by one what I was using.
The first step was getting rid of Google Reader, the next step
will be gmail (quite harder). I hope to be able to host everything
myself one day :-).
