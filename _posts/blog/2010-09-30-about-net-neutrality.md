I've been writing a short response to the
questionnaire on Net neutrality issued by
the European Commission. I only tried to
answer a few questions as I hadn't much
time, and as I was not able to formulate
real answers to others questions. My answer
is based on personal experiences with the filtering
of port 25 and Orange, but I think DPI would
have been a better topic.
