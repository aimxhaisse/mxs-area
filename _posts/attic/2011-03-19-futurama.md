*work in progress..*

One day I was looking for all those subtitles that are displayed at
the beginning of each Futurama episode, so ... I decided to watch them all
once again. Here are they:

## Season 1

 * *Episod 1*: _IN COLOR_
 * *Episod 2*: _IN HYPNO-VISION_
 * *Episod 3*: None?!
 * *Episod 4*: _Presented in BC (Brain Control) where available_
 * *Episod 5*: _Featuring GRATUITOUS ALIEN NUDITY_
 * *Episod 6*: _LOADING...._
 * *Episod 7*: _Presented in DOUBLE VISION (where drunk)_
 * *Episod 8*: _Mr. Bender's Wardrobe by ROBOTANY 500_
 * *Episod 9*: None?!
