## Introduction

Last days I've been coding a C implementation of
SHA-1 algorithm, I found this very interessting so let's write
about it. This algorithm is used to generate a hash from
an input, that can be useful not to store passwords in clear,
or to check the integrity of a file (the probability to have
the same hash for two different files is weak). I followed the
[RFC3174](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3174.html), you will find more information in it.
I will detail here a C implementation that generates hashes
from a string.

## First step: message padding

SHA-1 works by computing blocks of 512 bits using a specific
syntax for the last block to treat. If you work with strings,
that means you need to cut the string into blocks of 64 chars
(as one char is height bits), this is called message padding.
Because the world is not perfect, a string is not always a
multiple of 64 chars, that's why the last block needs to
store additionnal information about the string. Here is a
representation of the last block:

<center>
        <img src="/static/data/sha1-step1.png" alt="sha1, step one" />
</center>

The last block is composed of 4 parts:

1. the last part of the string
2. one single bit set to 1
3. a variable part filled with zeros
4. 64 bits where the length of the input string will be stored,
   that allows sha1 to hashes at maximum 2^64 bits

To generate this block, the last part of the string must be
less than 447 bits (512 - (64 + 1)) to have enough place for
the single bit and the length, if this is not the case, the
end must be filled with zero blanks and another block must
be generated.

Here is a piece of C code that can be used to generate
these blocks:

{% highlight c %}
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

typedef uint unsigned int;

static void
sha1_set_len(char *word, int len)
{
  uint                  ulen = len & 0xFFFFFFFF;

  word[60] = ulen >> 24;
  word[61] = ulen >> 16;
  word[62] = ulen >> 8;
  word[63] = ulen;
}

void
sha1_string(char *input)
{
  char                  word[64];
  int                   i, len, computed, flag;

  len = strlen(input);
  flag = 0;
  for (i = 0; i <= len; i += 64)
    {
      computed = i + 64 > len ? len % 64 : 64;
      strncpy(word, &input[i], computed);
      if (computed != 64)
        {
          memset(&word[computed], 0, 64 - computed);
          word[computed] = (char) 0x80;
          if (computed < 56)
            sha1_set_len(word, len * 8);
          else
            ++flag;
        }
      /* Compute the block here */
    }
  if (flag > 0)
    {
      memset(word, 0, 64);
      sha1_set_len(word, len * 8);
      /* Compute the block here */
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

Some notes about this piece of code, as we are dealing with
bytes, if we have the place for a single bit in the block,
we also have the place for 8 bits, that's why we set the last
bit to one by assigning one char (8 bits) to 0x80 (1000 0000
in binary).

To set the len, we use bitwise operations: we could perform a
memcpy of something like this, but this would'nt be compatible
everywhere for endianness issues. Note that this implementation
only stores 32 bits, that limits the size of the hashed input
to 2^32 bits, which is enough for a string.

## Second step: Generation of the hash

### Structure and initialization

The hash is made by performing several operations on each block,
using a temporary buffer of 2048 bits: __W__, and two little
buffers of 160 bits: __A__ and __H__.

As bitwise operations will be performed on these buffers, we need
to work with unsigned int arrays. It's also a good idea
to gather it in a structure because it will be used in several
functions:

{% highlight c %}
typedef struct          sha1_s   /* sha1 structure */
{
  uint                  w[80];   /* 16 + 64, used to compute */
  uint                  h[5];    /* contains H0 H1 H2 H3 H4 H5 */
  uint                  a[5];    /* contains A B C D E */
}                       sha1_t;

#define A               sha1->a[0]
#define B               sha1->a[1]
#define C               sha1->a[2]
#define D               sha1->a[3]
#define E               sha1->a[4]

#define H(x)           sha1->h[x]
{% endhighlight %}

__W__ and __A__ does not require any initialization: both will
be cleared before computing each block.H is initialized with some
constants defined in the RFC, so all we need to do at creation of
sha1_t structure is:

{% highlight c %}
static void
sha1_initialize(sha1_t *sha1)
{
  sha1->h[0] = 0x67452301;
  sha1->h[1] = 0xEFCDAB89;
  sha1->h[2] = 0x98BADCFE;
  sha1->h[3] = 0x10325476;
  sha1->h[4] = 0xC3D2E1F0;
}
{% endhighlight %}

### Let's use some tools

We'll use three functions to get a clean code:

The left circular shift: S^n(X) = (X << n) OR (X >> 32-n)

{% highlight c %}
static uint
sha1_op_left_shift(uint n, uint x)
{
  return (x << n) | (x >> (32 - n));
}
{% endhighlight %}

A function that performs different kind of bitwise operations
on buffer __A__ according to the current rank of __W__:

{% highlight c %}
static uint
sha1_f(int t, sha1_t *sha1)
{
  if (t < 20)
    return (B & C) | ((~B) & D);
  if (t < 40)
    return B ^ C ^ D;
  if (t < 60)
    return (B & C) | (B & D) | (C & D);
  return B ^ C ^ D;
}
{% endhighlight %}

Another function that depends on the current rank in __W__,
that will returns a different constant __K__:

{% highlight c %}
static uint
sha1_k(int t)
{
  if (t < 20)
    return 0x5A827999;
  if (t < 40)
    return 0x6ED9EBA1;
  if (t < 60)
    return 0x8F1BBCDC;
  return 0xCA62C1D6;
}
{% endhighlight %}

For more information about these three functions, I invite
you to have a look at the [RFC](http://www.apps.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3174.html)
(where they are used as defines, not functions).

### Now we are ready, let's create the hash

There are two available methods to generater the hash,
we will use the first one defined in the RFC.

At beginning, a first pass is made on __W__: the block
is copied at the beginning of __W__, then a left circularshift
is made to the end of __W__. This way, we get all ranks of __W__
initialized in a manner that is strongly linked to the block
(and so the input string).

{% highlight c %}
#define W(t)    sha1->w[t]

static void
sha1_compute_block_first_pass(uchar *block, sha1_t *sha1)
{
  for (t = 0; t < 16; t++)
    {
      W(t) = block[t * 4] << 24;
      W(t) |= block[t * 4 + 1] << 16;
      W(t) |= block[t * 4 + 2] << 8;
      W(t) |= block[t * 4 + 3];
    }
  for (t = 16; t < 80; t++)
    {
      W(t) = sha1_op_left_shift(1, W(t - 3) ^ W(t - 8) ^ W(t - 14) ^ W(t - 16));
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

We perform a second pass that aims at generating 5 values
(A,B,C,D,E) according to the content stored in __W__.

We first initialize A,B,C,D,E to H0,H1,H2,H3,H4

Then, for each rank of __W__, we make different kind of
bitwise operationson the rank we are computing. Finally, we add
to each rank of H the freshly generated corresponding value in A :

{% highlight c %}
void
sha1_compute_block_second_pass(uchar *block, sha1_t *sha1)
{
  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++)
    {
      sha1->a[i] = sha1->h[i];
    }
  for (t = 0; t < 80; t++)
    {
      tmp = sha1_op_left_shift(5, A) + sha1_f(t, sha1) + E + W(t) + sha1_k(t);
      E = D;
      D = C;
      C = sha1_op_left_shift(30, B);
      B = A;
      A = tmp;
    }
  for (i = 0; i < 5; i ++)
    {
      sha1->h[i] += sha1->a[i];
    }
}
{% endhighlight %}

## Last step: fetching the result

That's it, most of the work is done. After processing each blocks
of the string, the hash is the hexadecimal representation of bits
stored in __H__, we can easily get it like this:

{% highlight c %}
static char *
sha1_get_hash(sha1_t *sha1)
{
  char                  result[40 + 1];

  snprintf(result, 41, "%8x%8x%8x%8x%8x", H(0), H(1), H(2), H(3), H(4));
  return (strdup(result));
}
{% endhighlight %}
